# 3D-Reconstruction

This repository contain official implementation of "A Deep Learning Embedded System for 3D Human Face Shape Reconstruction From a Single Image" 

For running our model you should first contact to https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/index.php?nav=1-1-0&id=details to get Morph model and put it in the File of introduced_model

Altough the proposed model developed in both of keras and pytorch deep learning frameworks and get almost same result, result of paper attained with pytorch implementation. 

in order to achive more transparency we put MobileFace implementation in this repository and calculate all metrics which is written in original paper.

Introduced_model folder contain pytorch implementation of our model
